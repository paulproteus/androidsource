Emails
------

* From address is the user

* Only one request can be outstanding at a time

* The email we send BCC: us

* Every week or month or so, we look at the websi
  stale requests

<strikeout>

* From address is our Django app, which creates a mini forwarder
  (which I promise is easy!!) that sends the email to the requester


    e.g. if Asheesh requests Linux source for HTC G2
        From: Asheesh <HTC_G2-owner@our-site.com>
        BCC: asheesh@asheesh.org
        ...

    and when we receive emails to HTC_G2@oursite.com we look
        in an email forwarders table, find that SOME_KEY points to
        a Handset, which implicitly points to the Requester and other Subscribers,
        and we forward it to all those people

    (NOTE: the string we put in the email address is a 'slug', calculated
            in the usual Django-esque way to calculate a 'slug')

* The "From:" email address is really a secure key that lets someone send
  email to the group of people subscribed to updates for that phone.
